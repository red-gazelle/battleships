# battleships
This is a battleship game written in Python. The game uses two dimensional arrays to plot the location of a number of battleships.

The game board is displayed in the console and the user is asked to enter a column and a row to bomb.
the board will then update and mark the users guessed location with an 'x' if its a miss or '1' if it hits a ship.
a message is also displayed if the user enters a location off the grid.
